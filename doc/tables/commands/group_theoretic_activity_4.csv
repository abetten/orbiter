Incidence between groups is defined whenever the intersection has size s. "
1,"\verb'-subgroup_lattice_' \verb'create_coset_geometry' "," Pidx Pgrpidx Qidx Qgrpidx s "," Create flag transitive incidence structure from the gosets of the group Pidx in orbit Pidx and group Qgrpidx in orbit Qidx. Incidence between cosets is defined whenever the intersection has size s. "

1,"\verb'-create_flag_transitive_geometry' "," P Q ","Create a matrix of intersections of all groups in the class of P and all groups in the class of Q. The entry in the matrix is the size of the intersection of the i-th group in the orbit of P with the j-th group in the orbit of Q. The ordering of groups in the conkjugacy classes depends on the generating set for the group G. It is the ordering determined by the Schreier algorithm. The groups in the first row and first column are the groups P and Q which are given. "
